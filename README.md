# hero-wars-client
<p> This is a client-side application of a game developed as a final year university project for CS degree.
<p> Do not judge the quality of the code - for the first time developing a multiplayer game and for the first time developing a game on a game engine!

To run the game:
1) Download and run the Godot game engine: https://godotengine.org/download
2) Import all parts of the game: client, game-server, gateway-server and auth-server.
3) Run in the following order: auth-server, gateway-server, game-server, client.
4) Enjoy!
